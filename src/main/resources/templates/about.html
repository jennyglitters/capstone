        Welcome to Pesca Milagrosa, a proudly woman-owned tilapia farm in Dominican Republic. We’re passionate about raising high-quality red tilapia while embracing innovation and sustainability.

        Running a fish farm is no small task, which is why we’ve created our own Fish Tank Management System—a smart, easy-to-use system that helps us keep our fish healthy, track their growth, monitor water quality, and stay on top of feeding schedules. This means our tilapia get the best care possible, and we can run our farm more efficiently.

        As a woman-led business, we’re breaking barriers in aquaculture while providing fresh, responsibly farmed fish to our community. We believe in hard work, innovation, and creating a better future—one fish at a time.

        Thank you for being part of our journey!.
